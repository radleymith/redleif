                    <li>
                      Hosting: $100/month; - In order to respond to traffic you need dedicated web servers
                    </li>

                      Content gathering, knowledge shares - basically helping us get an understanding of what you want to build - Preliminary consultation is free, after that it's our hourly price.

            <p><em>There are basically two ways to go about getting a basic website.</em></p>
            <p>
              <strong>1. Do it yourself [Free - $50] -</strong> There is always the possibility of building a website yourself.  There are some truly great tools out there: Wix, Weebly, Squarespace.  These have come a long way in recent years and offer a lot of flexibility and customization.  They will however require a significant amount of time investment from you, as well as some technical knowledge.  Generally they also do not fare quite as well on search engine results either.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>2. Hire someone to build it [$2,000 - $5,000] -</strong> A basic website is what we suggest for most small businesses.  It adds a professional web presence to whatever type of business you have, adding a sense of legitimacy, helping to drive traffic to your brick and mortar locations.  You can think of it as virtual marketing, it acts as a brochure to your business so that people know what to expect when doing business with you.

                An advanced website is usually backed by a CMS(Content Management System). The website is created with both design and functionality in mind.  When you have a backing CMS it means that we will create a product that allows you to update most features of the website yourself.  The idea is that you have a website that you will want to update often and rather than pay someone to update it everytime you will be able to update it yourself.  The added complexity results in a much higher price than a basic website.  Often times this website will come with a <strong>blog</strong> that will allow you to interact directly with your audience.

              All sorts of websites and web applications fall under this category, networking, blogging, ecommerce, games, or online businesses.  Every piece of these applcations requires customization, they are also usually backed by databases and have some sort of authentication.  These types of projects are extremely complex and require not only a great deal of development work, but a lot of communication as well.  In the end this constitutes to a huge time commitment and thus comes with a very large price tag.  This isn't out of the ordinary, but when the requirements call for an application like that, the prices go up quickly.
